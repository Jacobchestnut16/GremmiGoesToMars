Currency is built off of purely `Ashcoins`, so when you make a transaction its based on how many `Ashcoins` you have.
So if you buy something worth 11 `MB` you're paying 1100 `Ashcoins`.
Wallet displays the coins in a way that makes it readable so for 11 `MB` it would show 1 `SS` 1 `MB`.

## Survival mode

Currency in `survival mode` has two versions, one is `sandboxed`, the other is `marketed`. 
In a `sandbox version`, this would be a *private server*, or *private play*; where every player the joins for the first time will start with `0`.
Once the player gains money that `money will only be saved to that specific save`.

`Marketed`, or a *non sandboxed version* of `survival mode`. Each player will start with `0` still, but every new log-on to any
*un-sandboxed survival plays*, the money will be consistent with what that players `currency is from the last game and last save`.
