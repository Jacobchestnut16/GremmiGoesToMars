| ----------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Voidberry Tart    | 1 Starshard     | A pitch-black pastry made with berries from the “Garden Between Realms.” Grants brief invisibility, but leaves a bitter taste in memory. |
