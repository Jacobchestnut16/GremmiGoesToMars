# Gremmi Goes To Mars

A goblin Banished to Mars by a petty kingdom
Gremmi, his name is, has only a few days to prepare for survival or ... be met with certain doom ... on Mars ...
His goals are
Befriend the witch, Unlock portals around Earth, Gather strange supplies, and Cast weird spells

All in this 2D survival fantasy where exile is just the beginning.

Craft. Farm. Fight. And maybeâ€¦ get even.
