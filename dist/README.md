# Gemmi Goes To Mars


Gremmi Goes to Mars
Exiled. Broke. Slightly radioactive.
Gremmi, a scrappy goblin with a taste for junk and rebellion, has just been sentenced to the worst punishment imaginable: banishment to Mars.

Stripped of his home and belongings by the human kingdom of Eldhollow, Gremmi has only few days on Earth
to prepare. Pack your shuttle. Scrounge for coins. Bribe the kingdom’s Debt Collector.
And — if you want any shot at survival — make a deal with the witch.

## 🌌 Explore, Survive, and Outwit Mars
Once launched, you'll land in a strange and hostile Martian frontier. Survive by crafting, farming,
and learning magic from the witch’s grimoire. Grow alien crops. Hunt for supplies.
Unlock spells like Flame or Time Freeze to protect yourself from what lurks beyond the crater edge.

## Or in the story mode follow the quests to be guided from earth to mars surviving with what you can gather

### 🔮 The Witch’s Questlands
Earn the witch’s trust to unlock mysterious portals back to ancient, forgotten biomes on Earth:

### 🌾 Sto Glyer – Whispering plains haunted by scavenger spirits

### 🌿 Smeekly Wamp – A festering swamp full of sleeping horrors

### 🔥 Deesek Savanna – Cracked deserts that hide burning beasts

### ❄️ Marsh Anke Land – A sunken tundra frozen in time

### 🌲 Pillos Hallow – A forest where memory and magic collide

Fight through each of these lands collect items and unlock new spells or crafts

## 💰 Deal With the Debt Collector
Before takeoff, Gremmi must settle a final score with the kingdom: pay, promise, or provoke.
Every choice changes what happens when the Debt comes to collect… on Mars.
