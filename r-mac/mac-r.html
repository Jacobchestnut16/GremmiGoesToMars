<h1>Mac-OS</h1>

<Pre>
    Install Directions:

    - Download the lastest Version, or another version of your choice
    - IMPORTANT Unzip the file in finder, MacOs lets you open and use zip files without opening them, but this will fail if you dont extract everything
    - Once unziped right click on the unzipped folder -> New terminal at Folder
    - Type these commands:
    chmod +x ./[Just press tab it should auto complete the file name for you, hit enter after]
    chmod -R 755 .[<- yes a '.' and Press enter]
    - Go back to finder open the folder and click on the file it will fail to open
    - Go to settings -> Privacy/Security, scroll to the bottom and you'll see the file there and a button that says 'open anyway' press this

    What this all did 'chmod +x ./[filename]' this adds execute permissions since the build is made from a windows pc it doesn't get this permission.
    'chmod -R 755 .' adds the correct read write execute permission necessary to run a file.
    Settings Privacy/Security is apples Gatekeeper, apple doesn't like files that it doesn't already know so this is the bypass Gatekeeper method.
